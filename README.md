mod-generator
=============

Generates Factorio mods.

## Supports

Many game primitives, inventory items, research, ores, text keys, overriding existing recipes

## TODO

* Recipes have build times
* Fluids
* Buildable things
* Consumable things
* License
* Electricity
* Examples
* Load mod data from a file, not hardcoded Ruby

## Much later

* Generate `raw_item()`, `raw_recipe()` etc automatically from a given Factorio install
